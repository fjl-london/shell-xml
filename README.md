# shell-xml
Utilities to get XML values in to shell script variables.

These were written to read values from OpenStreetMaps XML files in to a shell script
in order to decide what to do with them, as part of an automated processing system
for planet.osm and the like.

I may document them properly if there is any interst.

They're written in 'C' from FreeBSD but should run on anything POSIX.
